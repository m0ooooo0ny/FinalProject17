This is my final project for the class Intro to Technology: Programming.

The Way of Students is a text adventure game based in a mysterious dungeon where you have forgotten how you got there or who you are. Someone narrates to you in order to describe the room to you -- and that narrator is actually a real person. The rooms vary from dungeon like to large and golden, with sweeping ceilings. Throughout the game, the player collects items and attempts to use those items to create objects and beat encounters with other people. In the end, the player must try to escape a stairwell in order to beat the game and reach nirvana.

The title of the game is ripped from The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson.
