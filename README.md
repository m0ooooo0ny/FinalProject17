This is my final project for the class Intro to Technology: Programming.

BASIC GAME DESCRIPTION

The Way of Students is a text adventure game based in a mysterious dungeon where you have forgotten how you got there or who you are. Someone narrates to you in order to describe the room to you -- and that narrator is actually a real person. The rooms vary from dungeon like to large and golden, with sweeping ceilings. Throughout the game, the player collects items and attempts to use those items to create objects and beat encounters with other objects, such as a sentient, very hungry boiler. In the end, the player must try to escape a stairwell in order to beat the game and reach nirvana.

FURTHER ELABORATION

Although not as elaborated upon within the game, the game does mock the Magnet lifestyle, with a student falling asleep during class and dreaming up an elaborate escape scenario that involves escaping from the dungeon. The narrator is someone who failed to escape. There are many ways to die during the game, through deliberately inputting answers that are unacceptable to simply growing tired enough that the person should collapse.

SOURCES + HELP

The title of the game is ripped from The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson. Some other sources used include Damon, who showed me how to use loops to check for valid responses and helped play through the game, and my sister, who played through the game multiple times and showed me that it was indeed beatable.

http://introtopython.org/classes.html: helped me better understand classes, one of the intial worries when I first started the project.

https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#what-are-the-rules-for-local-and-global-variables-in-python: helped me understand global and local variables, and when to globalize them.

https://help.github.com/categories/managing-remotes/: helped me relearn how to create a remote repository and push to it.
